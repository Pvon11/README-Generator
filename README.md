## Description

My task for week 9 was to create a README generator. it requires you to npm install node modules and will require inquirer and the fs system.
This allows a person to dynamically create a README.md file. If you type node index.js into your intergrated terminal,
you will be provided a series of prompts. These prompts will provide the information for the skeleton of the README while. the file will be created and then put in the dist folder.
