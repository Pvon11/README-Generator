## Description

My task for week 9 was to create a README generator. it requires you to npm install node modules and will require the fs system.
this allows a person to dynamically create a README.md file. if you type node index.js into your intergrated terminal,
you will be provided a series of prompts. These prompts will provide the skeleton of the README while the user provides the
content for it. the file will be created and then put in the dist folder.
